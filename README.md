# matrix-inversion
#### inverse matrices without libraries with pure js

Project was started as a challenge from friend asking to write a program to solve simultaneous equations of 2 variables. 
Doing 2 variables was not really hard so I wanted to make one which could solve a system of equations of any arbitrary number of variables which I did using python and numpy library for matrix inversion. 
It was good enough but wanted to create one from scratch so this project was born.
